**WARNING: ONLY REDDIT ACCOUNTS WITH VERIFIED EMAIL ARE SUPPORTED.** If your account has a 20 minutes rate limit, this will not work well.

## How to use

1) Use a chromium based browser (Chromium will work)
2) Log in to Reddit
3) Go to your extension page (chrome://extensions/)
4) Load the unpacked extension. You might have to enable developer mode (not needed if downloaded via Chrome store)
5) (Important) Click on "service worker" to inspect it and leave that window opened in the background
6) Go to /r/place
7) You should see the subreddits name change to a message confirming the bot is working. If it doesn't work, make sure you did step 5 correctly.

## Use multiple accounts

You can use multiple accounts by opening multiple browser windows in private mode.
